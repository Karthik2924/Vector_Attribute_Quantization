### Vector Attribute Quantization (Master's Thesis)

* This method is mainly meant for disentanglement unlike vector quantization.
* Achieves very high INFOMEC scores for 3 different benchmark disentanglement datasets.
* Highly disentangled and compact codes are produced.

* attribute_quantizer.py is the file to run
* Download and convert the datasets into .npy or h5py formats.
* Adjust the location in fast_data.py
